## ROS Programming

### ROS Master (http://wiki.ros.org/Master)

The ROS Master provides naming and registration services to the rest of the nodes in the ROS system. It tracks publishers and subscribers to topics as well as services. The role of the Master is to enable individual ROS nodes to locate one another. Once these nodes have located each other they communicate with each other peer-to-peer.

Start with: 
```bash 
roscore
```

### ROS Nodes (http://wiki.ros.org/Nodes)

A node is a process that performs computation. Nodes are combined together into a graph and communicate with one another using streaming topics, RPC services, and the Parameter Server. These nodes are meant to operate at a fine-grained scale; a robot control system will usually comprise many nodes. For example, one node controls a laser range-finder, one Node controls the robot's wheel motors, one node performs localization, one node performs path planning, one node provide a graphical view of the system, and so on.

- Single purpose, executable program
- Individually compiled, executed, and managed
- Organized in *packages*.

Start a node:
```bash 
rosrun package_name node_name
```
List active nodes:
```bash
rosnode list
```

Get information about a node:
```bash
rosnode info node_name
```

### ROS Topics (http://wiki.ros.org/Topics)

Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. Topics have anonymous publish/subscribe semantics, which decouples the production of information from its consumption. In general, nodes are not aware of who they are communicating with. Instead, nodes that are interested in data subscribe to the relevant topic; nodes that generate data publish to the relevant topic. There can be multiple publishers and subscribers to a topic.

- Nodes communicate over topics
    - Nodes can *publish* or *subscribe* to a topic
    - Typically, 1 publisher and *n* subscribers
- Topic is a name for a stream of messages

List active topics:
```bash 
rostopic list
```

Subscribe and print the content of a topic:
```bash
rostopic echo /topic
```

Get information aboout a node:
```bash
rostopic info /topic
```

### ROS Messages (http://wiki.ros.org/Messages)


Nodes communicate with each other by publishing messages to topics. A message is a simple data structure, comprising typed fields. Standard primitive types (integer, floating point, boolean, etc.) are supported, as are arrays of primitive types. Messages can include arbitrarily nested structures and arrays (much like C structs).

- Data structure defining the *type* of a topic
- Comprised of nested structure of integers, strings, etc, and arrays of objects
- Defined in *.msg files

See the type of a topic:
```bash
rostopic type /topic
```

Publish a message to a topic:
```bash
rostopic pub /topic type args
```

#### Examples:

`sensor_msgs/Image.msg`:

```bash
# This message contains an uncompressed image
# (0, 0) is at top-left corner of image
#

Header header        # Header timestamp should be acquisition time of image
                     # Header frame_id should be optical frame of camera
                     # origin of frame should be optical center of camera
                     # +x should point to the right in the image
                     # +y should point down in the image
                     # +z should point into to plane of the image
                     # If the frame_id here and the frame_id of the CameraInfo
                     # message associated with the image conflict
                     # the behavior is undefined

uint32 height         # image height, that is, number of rows
uint32 width          # image width, that is, number of columns

# The legal values for encoding are in file src/image_encodings.cpp
# If you want to standardize a new string format, join
# ros-users@lists.sourceforge.net and send an email proposing a new encoding.

string encoding       # Encoding of pixels -- channel meaning, ordering, size
                      # taken from the list of strings in include/sensor_msgs/image_encodings.h

uint8 is_bigendian    # is this data bigendian?
uint32 step           # Full row length in bytes
uint8[] data          # actual matrix data, size is (step * rows)

```

`geometry_msgs/Point.msg`:
```bash
float64 x
float64 y
float64 z
```

`geometry_msgs/PoseStamped`:
```bash 
std_msgs/Header header
  uint32 seq
  time stamp
  string frame_id
geometry_msgs/Pose pose
  geometry_msgs/Pose pose
    float64 x
    float64 y
    float64 z
  geometry_msgs/Quaternion orientation
    float64 x
    float64 y
    float64 z
    float64 w
```

### ROS Launch (http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch)

roslaunch is a tool for easily launching multiple ROS nodes locally and remotely via SSH, as well as setting parameters on the Parameter Server. It includes options to automatically respawn processes that have already died. roslaunch takes in one or more XML configuration files (with the .launch extension) that specify the parameters to set and nodes to launch, as well as the machines that they should be run on.

- *launch* is a tool for launching multiple node and setting parameters on the parameter server
- Are written as XML-files with suffix `*.launch`

Start a local launch file
```bash 
roslaunch file_name.launch
```

Start a launch file located in a package:
```bash
roslauch package_name file_name.launch
```

```xml
<launch>
    <node name="listener" pkg="rospy_tutorials" type="listener" output="screen"/>
    <node name="talker" pkg="rospy_tutorials" type="talker" output="screen"/>
<launch/>
```

- `launch`: Root element of the launch file
- `node`: A node to be launched
- `name`: Name of the node to be launched
- `type`: Executable to be launched
- `output`: Output to console (screen) of logfile (log)

## Goal: 

The goals of this lecture is to:
1. get an introduction to ROS and
2. build a publish/subscribe ROS system. 
The system shall consist of one publisher node that grabs images from a webcam, forms a `sensor_msgs/Image.msg` message and publishes it on a topic, and one or more subscriber nodes that subscribes to the image topic and performs some computation on the image. 

An additional task is to encode the image such that other subscribers can read and display the image.

Steps:
1. Check out tutorials at: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/
2. Run the publish/subscribe tutorial at: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28python%29
3. Create a new package named `tpk4128`, following http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage
4. Create a package that implements the webcam image publisher and subscriber
